# AWS-Stream-Chat
### A stream chat tool that features AWS text to speech, check it out [here](http://readie.global-gaming.co/stream-chat/)!
**NOTE:**
THIS IS STILL IN A VERY EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, there will be many more features to come in the future such as voice commands and moderation tools. Currently you are able to connect to your Twitch channel and use the Brian TTS voice provided by AWS Polly.  
You will also need to log-in to my server to **save** your credentials, in the future I will add an option to save your details to the local machine only.
